# c-Si-PV-
We investigate the impact of reshoring silicon photovoltaic manufacturing to the environment. In this study, we perform the first analysis to clarify the energy and environmental impacts of bringing c-Si PV production back to the U.S. by comparing the offshore (outsourced) manufacturing cases from 2010 to 2020 and the reshored (domestic) manufacturing scenarios from 2020 to 2050. To unilaterally quantify the impact of reshoring, we study the climate change impact of the hypothetical reshored scenario in 2020 and compare it to the offshore case in the same year. We also interpret the climate implications of a delayed reshoring schedule. To understand how the expansion of the solar panel industry that already greens the power grid could further promote climate change mitigation during its manufacturing stages together with the power of reshoring, we forecast reshored PV panel manufacturing scenarios with renewable penetration to the energy supply.
